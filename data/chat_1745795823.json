Headaches are common and can be caused by a variety of things, from dehydration and stress to more serious issues.  \n\nBecause I'm not a medical professional, I can't offer medical advice or diagnose your headache.  It's important to talk to a doctor or other healthcare provider if your headache is severe, sudden, accompanied by other symptoms like fever, stiff neck, vision changes, numbness, or if it doesn't improve with over-the-counter pain relievers.\n\nWhile I can't give medical advice, I can offer some general information.  Some common causes of headaches include:\n\n* **Dehydration:** Make sure you're drinking enough water.\n* **Stress:** Stress can trigger tension headaches. Relaxation techniques may help.\n* **Eye strain:**  If you spend a lot of time looking at screens, try taking breaks and adjusting your lighting.\n* **Lack of sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\n* **Sinus issues:** Congestion can cause headaches.\n* **Certain foods or drinks:**  Caffeine withdrawal, alcohol, and certain food additives can trigger headaches.\n\nRemember, this is not an exhaustive list, and it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment. If you're concerned about your headache, please schedule an appointment with a doctor.\n"}]
