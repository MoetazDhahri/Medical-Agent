I can definitely understand that being super sick is a miserable experience.  While I can't diagnose or treat your illness (I'm just a chatbot, not a doctor!), I can offer some support.  Could you tell me a bit more about your symptoms?  Knowing what's bothering you will help me suggest some things you can do in the meantime, and will also help you explain things clearly to a real-life medical professional.  \n\n**Remember, I'm here to help, but I strongly advise you to seek advice from a qualified doctor or other healthcare provider as soon as possible. They can give you the personalized care and attention you need.**\n"}]
