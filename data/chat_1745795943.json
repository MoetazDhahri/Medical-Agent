While I can offer some general information, it's *really important* to remember I'm not a doctor.  Seeing a medical professional is always the best course of action for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nWith that said, a headache and fever could be caused by several things, like a common cold, the flu, or even dehydration.  Make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids.  Resting in a cool, dark room might also help.  \n\nIf your fever gets very high, you experience a stiff neck, severe headache, confusion, or difficulty breathing, please seek immediate medical attention.  Do you have any other symptoms you'd like to tell me about? I can help you find local clinics or telehealth resources.  Take care!\n"}]
